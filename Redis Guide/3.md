# Redis: In-Memory NoSQL Key-Value Store Guide

## Overview

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an **in-memory data structure store** that serves as a **database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine**. Its in-memory nature gives it exceptional performance characteristics.

### Key Features

- **Speed:** Operations execute in microseconds since data is stored in RAM.
- **Data Structures:** Supports complex structures beyond simple key-value pairs, including:
  - Strings
  - Lists
  - Sets
  - Sorted Sets
  - Hashes
  - Bitmaps
  - HyperLogLogs
  - Geospatial indexes
  - Streams

## Key-Value Model vs Relational Databases

- No tables, rows, or columns.
- No joins or complex query language.
- Simple key lookup with **O(1) time complexity** for most operations.
- Values can be simple strings or complex data structures.

## Persistence Options

While Redis stores data in memory, it provides multiple **persistence** options:

### **RDB (Redis Database)**

- **Description:** Takes snapshots at specified intervals.
- **Pros:** Compact files, faster restart, good for backups.
- **Cons:** Data loss between snapshots if Redis crashes.
- **Configuration Example:**
  ```bash
  save 900 1      # Save if at least 1 key changes in 900 seconds
  save 300 10     # Save if at least 10 keys change in 300 seconds
  save 60 10000   # Save if at least 10000 keys change in 60 seconds
  ```

### **AOF (Append Only File)**

- **Description:** Logs every write operation.
- **Pros:** More durable, can be configured to fsync every second or every command.
- **Cons:** Larger files, slower restarts, potential fsync performance impact.
- **Configuration Example:**
  ```bash
  appendonly yes
  appendfsync everysec  # Options: always, everysec, no
  ```
**fsync is a system call that forces the operating system to write all buffered data to disk, ensuring data durability. In Redis, fsync is used in the Append Only File (AOF) persistence mode to control when data is written to disk**

###fsync in Redis affects performance and durability:

  - always â†’ Safest but slowest (writes every operation to disk).
  - everysec â†’ Good balance (writes to disk every second, minimal data loss risk).
  - no â†’ Fastest but risky (relies on OS to flush data, potential data loss).
- For most production use cases, everysec is recommended to balance durability and performance. ðŸš€

### **Hybrid Approach:**

Combining **RDB** and **AOF** provides the benefits of both and is recommended for **production environments**.

## Transport Protocol: RESP (Redis Serialization Protocol)

Redis uses **RESP**, a simple text-based protocol:

- Human-readable, easy to debug.
- Low overhead and supports **pipelining** (sending multiple commands at once).

### **Basic RESP Communication Example**

```plaintext
Client: *2\r\n$4\r\nLLEN\r\n$6\r\nmylist\r\n
Server: :48293\r\n
```

## Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe)

Redis supports a **Publish-Subscribe messaging paradigm**, where:

- **Publishers** send messages to channels without knowing subscribers.
- **Subscribers** express interest in one or more channels.
- **Messages are delivered without storing them (non-persistent).**

### **Pub/Sub Commands**

```bash
PUBLISH channel message       # Sends a message to a channel
SUBSCRIBE channel [channel]   # Subscribes to channels
PSUBSCRIBE pattern [pattern]  # Pattern-based subscription
UNSUBSCRIBE [channel]         # Unsubscribes from channels
```

### **Use Cases**

- Real-time notifications
- Chat applications
- Event distribution systems
- System monitoring and alerts

**Note:** Redis pub/sub **does not persist messages**. Offline subscribers miss messages sent while disconnected.

## Replication and Clustering

Redis supports high availability and scaling via **Replication and Clustering**.

### **Replication**

- **Master-Replica architecture**
- **Asynchronous replication**
- Replicas distribute read workload and provide high availability.
- Automatic reconnection and resynchronization.

**Basic Replica Setup:**

```bash
replicaof 192.168.1.1 6379
```

### **Clustering**

- **Automatic data sharding across multiple nodes**.
- **No single point of failure**.
- **Linear scaling by adding nodes**.
- Uses **16384 hash slots** for key distribution.

**Cluster Configuration:**

```bash
cluster-enabled yes
cluster-config-file nodes.conf
cluster-node-timeout 5000
```

**Redis Sentinel** provides **automatic failover** for high availability.

## Practical Examples

### **Setting Up Redis Using Docker**

```bash
# Start Redis server
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis

# Connect to Redis CLI
docker exec -it redis redis-cli
```

### **Basic Redis Commands**

```bash
# Set a key
SET username "john_doe"

# Get a key
GET username

# Set a key with expiration (1 hour)
SET temp_token "abc123" EX 3600

# Check if a key exists
EXISTS username
EXISTS nonexistent_key

# Delete a key
DEL username

# Append to string value
SET greeting "Hello"
APPEND greeting " World!"
GET greeting  # Returns "Hello World!"
```

### **Pub/Sub Example**

**In one terminal:**

```bash
SUBSCRIBE notifications
```

**In another terminal:**

```bash
PUBLISH notifications "System update scheduled for midnight"
```

### **Data Structure Examples**

```bash
# Lists
LPUSH tasks "send email"
LPUSH tasks "write report"
LRANGE tasks 0 -1  # Get all items

# Sets
SADD tags "redis" "database" "nosql"
SMEMBERS tags

# Hashes (structured data)
HSET user:1000 username "alice" email "alice@example.com" active 1
HGETALL user:1000
```
