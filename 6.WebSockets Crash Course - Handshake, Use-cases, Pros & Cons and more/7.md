## Introduction to Web Servers

A web server is a specialized software application that serves content over the internet using the HTTP protocol. Web servers form the foundation of the World Wide Web, handling requests from clients (typically browsers) and delivering the appropriate responses, whether static files (HTML, CSS, images) or dynamically generated content.

## Web Server Fundamentals

### Core Functionality

- **HTTP Protocol Handling**: Processing HTTP requests and generating appropriate responses
- **Resource Management**: Serving static files and handling dynamic content generation
- **Connection Management**: Establishing, maintaining, and closing client connections
- **Security**: Implementing authentication, authorization, and encryption (HTTPS/TLS)
- **Logging**: Recording access and error information for monitoring and troubleshooting

### The Request-Response Cycle
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daef027e-9fdf-4509-bfd4-395add4c2f36)


1. Client initiates a connection to the server (TCP handshake)
2. If HTTPS, a TLS handshake occurs
3. Client sends an HTTP request (GET, POST, etc.)
4. Server processes the request
5. Server returns an HTTP response
6. Connection is either kept alive (HTTP keep-alive) or closed

**The TCP[[TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a fundamental internet protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data packets between devices, working in conjunction with IP (Internet Protocol) to form the TCP/IP suite. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Purpose:
TCP's primary function is to establish a reliable connection between two applications on different computers, ensuring that data is transmitted accurately and in the correct sequence]] handshake is a three-step process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) used to establish a reliable TCP connection between a client and a server, ensuring both sides are ready to exchange data.** 

Here's a breakdown:

Step 1: SYN (Client to Server):

The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, indicating its intention to initiate a connection and including an initial sequence number. 

Step 2: SYN-ACK (Server to Client):

The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet, acknowledging the client's SYN and including its own initial sequence number. 

Step 3: ACK (Client to Server):

The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server, acknowledging the server's SYN-ACK and completing the handshake


The TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake is a process that allows a client and server to establish a secure, encrypted connection by exchanging messages to authenticate each other, agree on encryption algorithms, and generate shared secret keys. 
Here's a breakdown of the TLS handshake process:
1. Client Initiates Connection:
The client (e.g., a web browser) initiates a connection to a TLS-enabled server (e.g., a web server). 
The client sends a "Client Hello" message, including:
Its supported TLS versions. 
A list of supported cipher suites (encryption algorithms). 
A random number (Client Random) for key generation. 
2. Server Responds: 
The server receives the "Client Hello" message.
The server responds with a "Server Hello" message, including:
Its selected TLS version (chosen from the client's list).
The selected cipher suite (chosen from the client's list).
A random number (Server Random) for key generation.
The server sends its digital certificate for client verification.
The certificate contains the server's public key, which is used for encryption and authentication.
3. Client Verifies and Exchanges Keys:
The client verifies the authenticity of the server's certificate using trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). 
The client and server then use the selected cipher suite and the exchanged random numbers to generate a shared secret key (session key). 
The client encrypts a pre-master secret using the server's public key and sends it to the server. 
The server decrypts the pre-master secret using its private key. 
Both parties then use the pre-master secret and the random numbers to derive the final session key. 
4. Secure Communication Begins: 
Once the handshake is complete, the client and server can communicate securely using the established session key.
All subsequent data exchanged between the client and server will be encrypted using the agreed-upon encryption algorithms.

## Web Server Architectures

### Single-Threaded Blocking Servers
- **Characteristics**: Processes one request at a time on a single thread
- **Advantages**: Simple implementation, low memory overhead
- **Disadvantages**: Poor concurrency, blocks during I/O operations
- **Example**: Basic Python HTTP server using `http.server`

### Multi-Threaded Servers
- **Characteristics**: Creates a new thread for each connection
- **Advantages**: Simple programming model, good for CPU-bound tasks
- **Disadvantages**: Thread creation overhead, potential resource exhaustion
- **Example**: Apache HTTP Server (traditional mode)

### Event-Driven/Non-Blocking Servers
- **Characteristics**: Uses event loops and callbacks to handle multiple connections
- **Advantages**: Efficient resource usage, excellent for I/O-bound workloads
- **Disadvantages**: More complex programming model, potential callback hell
- **Example**: Node.js HTTP server, Nginx

### Hybrid Approaches
- **Characteristics**: Combines multiple worker processes with event-driven I/O
- **Advantages**: Balanced approach, scalable across multiple cores
- **Disadvantages**: More complex configuration
- **Example**: Apache with event MPM, Nginx worker processes
