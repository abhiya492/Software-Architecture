## Overview

A web server is a software system that serves web content over the HTTP protocol. It forms the backbone of the internet, hosting everything from simple static websites to complex web applications and APIs. Every website you visit is served by some form of web server.

## Core Concepts

### Basic Functionality
- Listens for incoming HTTP requests on specified ports (typically 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS)
- Processes requests and returns appropriate responses
- Handles multiple concurrent connections
- Serves both static files and dynamic content
- Manages security and access control

### Protocol Support
- HTTP/1.1
- HTTP/2
- HTTPS (with TLS/SSL)
- WebSocket (for real-time communications)

**Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that encrypts data to secure communication over networks like the internet**

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol that encrypts data sent between a server and a client. It's used to protect data from being stolen or intercepted by hackers**

**How TLS works**
   - TLS is a client-server protocol that uses cryptographic protocols( set of rules that use cryptography to secure information) to secure communication. 
   - To establish a secure connection, the server must provide a valid digital certificate that confirms its identity. 
   - Both the client and server can authenticate each other if they each provide a digital certificate. 
   - TLS prevents unauthorized access to messages when they're sent over the internet.

**How SSL works**
   - SSL uses public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. 
   - SSL verifies the identity of both the client and the server through a process called a handshake. 
   - SSL digitally signs data to ensure that it hasn't been tampered with during transmission between a sender and receiver, effectively guaranteeing data authenticity. 

**SSL and TLS**
   - SSL has been replaced by the more modern and secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
     
**SSL certificates**
   - SSL certificates, also known as digital certificates, establish an encrypted connection between a user's computer and a website.
     
**SSL and HTTPS**
   - Websites that use SSL/TLS have "HTTPS" in their URL instead of "HTTP". Browsers indicate a secure connection with visual cues like a green padlock or a branded URL bar. 

**TLS vs. SSL**
TLS is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. 
All major browsers support TLS, and most have stopped supporting TLS 1.0 and 1.1.

## Architecture and Flow

### Request Processing Flow
1. **Connection Establishment**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       Client->>Server: TCP Connection Request
       Server->>Client: TCP Connection Accepted
       Note over Client,Server: TLS Handshake (if HTTPS)
       Client->>Server: HTTP Request
       Server->>Client: HTTP Response
   ```

2. **Processing Models**
   - Single-threaded (Blocking)
   - Multi-threaded
   - Event-driven (Non-blocking)

### Example: Basic Node.js Web Server
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // Set response headers
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    
    // Handle different routes
    if (req.url === '/') {
        res.end('Welcome to the home page!');
    } else if (req.url === '/api/status') {
        res.end('Server is running');
    } else {
        res.statusCode = 404;
        res.end('Not Found');
    }
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}/`);
});
```

### Example: Basic Python Web Server (using Tornado)
```python
import tornado.ioloop
import tornado.web

class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        self.write("Hello, World!")

class ApiHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        self.write({"status": "running"})

def make_app():
    return tornado.web.Application([
        (r"/", MainHandler),
        (r"/api/status", ApiHandler),
    ])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = make_app()
    app.listen(8888)
    print("Server running at http://localhost:8888")
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()
```

## Types of Web Servers

### 1. Production-Ready Web Servers
- **Apache HTTP Server (httpd)**
  - Most popular web server
  - Excellent for static content
  - Modular architecture
  
- **Nginx**
  - High-performance event-driven server
  - Excellent for reverse proxy and load balancing
  
- **Apache Tomcat**
  - Java-based server
  - Specializes in Java Servlets and JSP

### 2. Application Servers
- **Node.js with Express**
  - JavaScript-based
  - Event-driven and non-blocking
  - Great for real-time applications

- **Python with Django/Flask**
  - Python-based
  - Full-featured frameworks
  - Good for data-intensive applications

## Real-World Applications

### 1. E-Commerce Platform
```javascript
// Express.js E-Commerce API Example
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/products', (req, res) => {
    // Get products from database
    const products = [
        { id: 1, name: 'Laptop', price: 999.99 },
        { id: 2, name: 'Smartphone', price: 499.99 }
    ];
    res.json(products);
});

app.post('/api/orders', express.json(), (req, res) => {
    // Process order
    const order = req.body;
    // Save to database
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Order created', orderId: 'ORD123' });
});
```

### 2. Content Management System (CMS)
```python
# Flask CMS Route Example
from flask import Flask, render_template
from database import get_articles

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/articles')
def articles():
    articles = get_articles()
    return render_template('articles.html', articles=articles)

@app.route('/article/<article_id>')
def article(article_id):
    article = get_article(article_id)
    return render_template('article.html', article=article)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use security headers

2. **Performance**
   - Enable compression
   - Implement caching
   - Use connection pooling for databases
   - Configure proper timeouts

3. **Scalability**
   - Use load balancers
   - Implement horizontal scaling
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Use CDNs for static content

4. **Monitoring**
   - Log important events
   - Monitor server metrics
   - Set up alerts
   - Implement health checks

## Example Configuration (Nginx)
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";

    # Compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript;

    # Static files
    location /static/ {
        root /var/www/;
        expires 30d;
    }

    # Proxy to application server
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```
