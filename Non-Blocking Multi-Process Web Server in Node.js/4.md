# Non-Blocking Multi-Process Web Server in Node.js

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **non-blocking, multi-process web server** in Node.js to handle computationally expensive operations efficiently. It utilizes **child process forking** to delegate expensive calculations to separate worker processes, ensuring that the main server remains responsive.

## Features
- **Handles expensive computations without blocking** the main event loop.
- **Uses child processes** to execute computations asynchronously.
- **Supports query parameter validation** for better error handling.
- **Implements a worker pool** to optimize process management.
- **Handles timeouts and errors gracefully.**

## Problem Statement
A typical web server may block when performing CPU-intensive operations, such as checking for prime numbers. This leads to poor performance, making it difficult to handle multiple concurrent requests. This project solves the problem using the **multi-process approach**.

## Implementation Approaches
We explore three different approaches:

### 1. **Blocking Single Process Implementation**
- Runs all computations in the main thread.
- Any expensive operation blocks the entire server.

### 2. **Non-Blocking Single Process (Event Loop Based)**
- Uses **`setImmediate`** to break computations into chunks.
- Prevents blocking but still limited to a single CPU core.

### 3. **Non-Blocking Multi-Process Implementation (Recommended)**
- Spawns child processes using **`fork()`**.
- Each request is handled by a separate worker process.
- Ensures efficient CPU utilization and non-blocking execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Node.js installed** (v14+ recommended).

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/non-blocking-server.git
   cd non-blocking-server
   ```
2. **Install dependencies (if any):**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server
Start the web server:
```sh
node server.js
```

The server will listen on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Usage
You can test the API by making a GET request:
```sh
curl "http://localhost:8080/isprime?number=43686389"
```
#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "number": 43686389,
  "isPrime": true,
  "time": 200,
  "workerId": 12345,
  "algorithm": "standard"
}
```

## Code Explanation

### **Main Server (server.js)**
- **Parses query parameters** (`number`, `timeout`, `algorithm`).
- **Spawns worker processes using `fork()`** to handle expensive computations.
- **Manages timeouts and errors** to ensure reliability.
- **Implements a worker pool** to optimize resource usage.

### **Worker Process (worker.js)**
- **Receives messages from the main server**.
- **Executes the prime number check algorithm**.
- **Returns results to the main server** asynchronously.
- **Supports different algorithms (`standard`, `optimized`).**

## Worker Pool Optimization
- Maintains a **pool of worker processes** instead of forking new processes for each request.
- **Reduces process creation overhead**, improving performance.
- Cleans up **idle workers** after a timeout period to save system resources.

## Pros & Cons of Multi-Process Approach
### ✅ Pros:
- **Non-blocking**: The main server remains responsive.
- **Multi-core utilization**: Workers run on separate CPU cores.
- **Isolation**: If a worker crashes, the main server is unaffected.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales by increasing worker pool size.

### ❌ Cons:
- **More complex** than single-threaded implementations.
- **Higher memory usage** due to multiple processes.
- **Inter-process communication overhead.**

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a **priority queue** for processing requests.
- Add **WebSocket support** for real-time progress updates.
- Integrate **Docker** for containerized deployment.
- Implement **advanced logging** and monitoring using Prometheus & Grafana.
